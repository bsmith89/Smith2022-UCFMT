    information is given: (i) description of the target for binding,
    (ii) description of the protein or peptide which serves as the
    template for library construction and description of the native
    protein which binds the target, (iii) links to the major proteomic

    has a user-friendly interface which allows for simple queries
    using the names of proteins and ligands, as well as keywords
    describing the biological role of the interaction studied, and
    also for queries based on authors' names. It is also possible to
    access the database by means of the SRS system, allowing complex

    result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and
    environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota.
    Multiple clinical and animal data have shown that Akkermansia
    muciniphila is associated with a healthy mucosa. However, its
    precise role in colitis is currently unknown. Our study aimed to
    determine its protective effects and underlying mechanisms in a
    dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model.
    Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were administered A. muciniphila
    MucT or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once daily by oral gavage
    for 14 days. Colitis was induced by drinking 2\% DSS from day 0 to
    day 6, followed by 2 days of drinking normal water. Mice were
    weighed daily and then sacrificed on day 8. We found that A.
    muciniphila improved DSS-induced colitis, which was evidenced by
    reduced weight loss, colon length shortening and histopathology
    scores and enhanced barrier function. Serum and tissue levels of
    inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-{$\alpha$},
    IL1{$\alpha$}, IL6, IL12A, MIP-1A, G-CSF and KC) decreased as a
    result of A. muciniphila administration. Analysis of 16S rDNA
    sequences showed that A. muciniphila induced significant gut
    microbiota alterations. Furthermore, correlation analysis
    indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokines and other injury factors
    were negatively associated with Verrucomicrobia, Akkermansia,
    Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae, which were prominently abundant
    in A. muciniphila-treated mice. We confirmed that A. muciniphila
    treatment could ameliorate mucosal inflammation either via
    microbe-host interactions, which protect the gut barrier function
    and reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, or by improving
    the microbial community. Our findings suggest that A. muciniphila
    may be a potential probiotic agent for ameliorating colitis.},

  abstract     = {Scythe uses a Naive Bayesian approach to classify
    contaminant substrings in sequence reads. It considers quality
    information, which can make it robust in picking out 3'-end
    adapters, which often include poor quality bases. Most next
    generation sequencing reads have deteriorating quality towards the
    3'-end. It's common for a quality-based trimmer to be employed
    before mapping, assemblies, and analysis to remove these poor
    quality bases. However, quality-based trimming could remove bases
    that are helpful in identifying (and removing) 3'-end adapter
    contaminants. Thus, it is recommended you run Scythe before
    quality-based trimming, as part of a read quality control
    pipeline. The Bayesian approach Scythe uses compares two
    likelihood models: the probability of seeing the matches in a
    sequence given contamination, and not given contamination. Given
    that the read is contaminated, the probability of seeing a certain
    number of matches and mismatches is a function of the quality of
    the sequence. Given the read is not contaminated (and is thus
    assumed to be random sequence), the probability of seeing a
    certain number of matches and mismatches is chance. The posterior
    is calculated across both these likelihood models, and the class
    (contaminated or not contaminated) with the maximum posterior
    probability is the class selected.},

  abstract     = {Microbial communities are commonly characterized by
    amplifying and sequenc-ing target genes, but errors limit the
    precision of amplicon sequencing. We present DADA2, a software
    package that models and corrects amplicon errors. DADA2 identified
    more real variants than other methods in Illumina-sequenced mock
    communities, some differing by a single nucleotide, while
    outputting fewer spurious sequences. DADA2 analysis of vaginal
    samples revealed a di-versity of Lactobacillus crispatus strains
    undetected by OTU methods. The importance of microbial communities
    to human and environmental health has moti-vated methods for their
    efficient characterization. The most common, and cost-effective,
    method is the amplification and sequencing of targeted genetic
    elements. Amplicon se-quencing of taxonomic marker genes such as
    16S rRNA [1], the ITS region [2] or 18S rRNA [3] provides a census
    of a community. Functional diversity can be probed by targeting
    functional genes [4]. Disentangling errors from biological
    variation in amplicon sequencing data presents unique challenges,
    which has prompted the development of amplicon-specific
    error-correction meth-ods [5, 6, 7, 8]. Most of these methods were
    designed for pyrosequenced amplicons, and cannot be applied to
    Illumina sequencing.},

  abstract     = {For fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to be
    successful in complex immune diseases like inflammatory bowel
    disease (IBD), it is assumed that therapeutic microbes and their
    beneficial functions and immune interactions must colonize the
    recipient and persist in sufficient quantity and for a long enough
    period of time to result in a clinical benefit. But few studies
    have comprehensively profiled the colonization and persistence of
    transferred microbes along with the transfer of their microbial
    and immune functions. Using 16S, metagenomic, and immunoglobulin A
    (IgA) sequencing, we analyzed hundreds of longitudinal microbiome
    samples from a randomized controlled trial of 12 patients with
    ulcerative colitis who received fecal transplant or placebo for 12
    weeks. We uncovered a range of competitive dynamics among donor
    and patient strains, showing that persistence of transferred
    microbes is far from static. Indeed, one patient experienced
    dramatic loss of donor bacteria 10 weeks into the trial,
    coinciding with a bloom of pathogenic bacteria and worsening
    clinical symptoms. We similarly evaluated transfer of microbial
    functions, including desired ones like butyrate production and
    unintended ones like antibiotic resistance. By profiling bacteria
    coated with IgA, we identified IgA-coated bacteria associated with
    inflammation, and we found that microbial interactions with the
    host immune system can be transferred across people. This transfer
    of immune function is likely critical for gut microbiome
    therapeutics for immune-related diseases. Our findings elucidate
    the colonization dynamics of gut microbes as well as their
    functions in the context of FMT to treat a complex
    disease---information that may provide a critical foundation for
    the development of more-targeted therapeutics.},

    with active UC, aged 27\textendash 50 years, were treated with 25
    multidonor FMT capsules daily for 50 days as a supplement to their
    standard treatment in an open-label pilot study. The primary
    objective was to follow symptoms through the Simple Clinical
    Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI). Secondary objectives were to
    follow changes in fecal calprotectin and microbial diversity
    through fecal samples and quality of life through the Inflammatory
    Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Participants were followed
    through regular visits for six months.Results: From a median of 6
    at baseline, the SCCAI of all participants decreased, with median
    decreases of 5 (p = .001) and 6 (p = .001) after 4 and 8 weeks,
    respectively. Three of the seven patients had flare-up/relapse of
    symptoms after the active treatment period. The median
    F-calprotectin of {$\geq$}1800 mg/kg at baseline decreased
    significantly during the treatment period, but increased again in
    the follow-up period. The median IBDQ improved at all visits
    compared to baseline. The fecal microbiota {$\alpha$}-diversity
    did not increase in the study period compared to baseline. All
    participants completed the treatment and no serious adverse events
    were reported.Conclusion: Fifty days of daily multidonor FMT
    capsules temporarily improved symptoms and health-related life
    quality and decreased F-calprotectin in patients with active UC.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
    is emerging as a novel therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC).
    Interpretation of efficacy of FMT for UC is complicated by
    differences among studies in blinding, FMT administration
    procedures, intensity of therapy and donor stool processing
    methods. AIM: To determine whether FMT is effective and safe for
    the induction of remission in active UC. METHODS: Medline (Ovid),
    Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception
    through February 2017. Original studies reporting remission rates
    following FMT for active UC were included. All study designs were
    included in the systematic review and a meta-analysis performed
    including only randomised controlled trials (RCTs). RESULTS: There
    were 14 cohort studies and four RCTs that used markedly different
    protocols. In the meta-analysis of RCTs, clinical remission was
    achieved in 39 of 140 (28\%) patients in the donor FMT groups
    compared with 13 of 137 (9\%) patients in the placebo groups; odds
    ratio 3.67 (95\% CI: 1.82-7.39, P{$<$}.01). Clinical response was
    achieved in 69 of 140 (49\%) donor FMT patients compared to 38 of
    137 (28\%) placebo patients; odds ratio 2.48 (95\% CI: 1.18-5.21,
    P=.02). In cohort studies, 39 of 168 (24\%; 95\% CI: 11\%-40\%)
    achieved clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS: Despite variation in
    processes, FMT appears to be effective for induction of remission
    in UC, with no major short-term safety signals. Further studies
    are needed to better define dose frequency and preparation methods
    and explore its feasibility, efficacy and safety as a maintenance

    fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has demonstrated efficacy
    in treating active ulcerative colitis (UC). FMT protocols
    involving anaerobic stool processing methods may enhance microbial
    viability and allow efficacy with a lower treatment intensity.
    Objective: To assess the efficacy of a short duration of FMT
    therapy to induce remission in UC using anaerobically prepared
    stool. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 73 adults
    with mild to moderately active UC were enrolled in a multicenter,
    randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 3 Australian tertiary
    referral centers between June 2013 and June 2016, with 12-month
    follow-up until June 2017. Interventions: Patients were randomized
    to receive either anaerobically prepared pooled donor FMT
    (n\,=\,38) or autologous FMT (n\,=\,35) via colonoscopy followed
    by 2 enemas over 7 days. Open-label therapy was offered to
    autologous FMT participants at 8 weeks and they were followed up
    for 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was
    steroid-free remission of UC, defined as a total Mayo score of
    {$\leq$}2 with an endoscopic Mayo score of 1 or less at week 8.
    Total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 (0\,=\,no disease and
    12\,=\,most severe disease). Steroid-free remission of UC was
    reassessed at 12 months. Secondary clinical outcomes included
    adverse events. Results: Among 73 patients who were randomized
    (mean age, 39 years; women, 33 [45\%]), 69 (95\%) completed the
    trial. The primary outcome was achieved in 12 of the 38
    participants (32\%) receiving pooled donor FMT compared with 3 of
    the 35 (9\%) receiving autologous FMT (difference, 23\% [95\% CI,
    4\%-42\%]; odds ratio, 5.0 [95\% CI, 1.2-20.1]; P\,=\,.03). Five
    of the 12 participants (42\%) who achieved the primary end point
    at week 8 following donor FMT maintained remission at 12 months.
    There were 3 serious adverse events in the donor FMT group and 2
    in the autologous FMT group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this
    preliminary study of adults with mild to moderate UC, 1-week
    treatment with anaerobically prepared donor FMT compared with
    autologous FMT resulted in a higher likelihood of remission at 8
    weeks. Further research is needed to assess longer-term
    maintenance of remission and safety. Trial Registration:

  abstract     = {Bile acids are a group of chemically different
    steroids generated at the host/microbial interface. Indeed, while
    primary bile acids are the end-product of cholesterol breakdown in
    the host liver, secondary bile acids are the products of microbial
    metabolism. Primary and secondary bile acids along with their oxo
    derivatives have been identified as signaling molecules acting on
    a family of cell membrane and nuclear receptors collectively known
    as ``bile acid-activated receptors.'' Members of this group of
    receptors are highly expressed throughout the gastrointestinal
    tract and mediate the bilateral communications of the intestinal
    microbiota with the host immune system. The expression and
    function of bile acid-activated receptors FXR, GPBAR1, PXR, VDR,
    and ROR{$\gamma$}t are highly dependent on the structure of the
    intestinal microbiota and negatively regulated by intestinal
    inflammation. Studies from gene ablated mice have demonstrated
    that FXR and GPBAR1 are essential to maintain a tolerogenic
    phenotype in the intestine, and their ablation promotes the
    polarization of intestinal T cells and macrophages toward a
    pro-inflammatory phenotype. ROR{$\gamma$}t inhibition by oxo-bile
    acids is essential to constrain Th17 polarization of intestinal
    lymphocytes. Gene-wide association studies and functional
    characterizations suggest a potential role for impaired bile acid
    signaling in development inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In
    this review, we will focus on how bile acids and their receptors
    mediate communications of intestinal microbiota with the
    intestinal immune system, describing dynamic changes of bile acid
    metabolism in IBD and the potential therapeutic application of
    targeting bile acid signaling in these disorders.},

    transfer is still the default for (meta-)genome annotation. We,
    therefore, developed eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional
    annotation of large sets of sequences based on fast orthology
    assignments using precomputed clusters and phylogenies from the
    eggNOG database. To validate our method, we benchmarked Gene
    Ontology (GO) predictions against two widely used homology-based
    approaches: BLAST and InterProScan. Orthology filters applied to
    BLAST results reduced the rate of false positive assignments by
    11\%, and increased the ratio of experimentally validated terms
    recovered over all terms assigned per protein by 15\%. Compared
    with InterProScan, eggNOG-mapper achieved similar proteome
    coverage and precision while predicting, on average, 41 more terms
    per protein and increasing the rate of experimentally validated
    terms recovered over total term assignments per protein by 35\%.
    EggNOG-mapper predictions scored within the top-5 methods in the
    three GO categories using the CAFA2 NK-partial benchmark. Finally,
    we evaluated eggNOG-mapper for functional annotation of
    metagenomics data, yielding better performance than interProScan.
    eggNOG-mapper runs {$\sim$}15\texttimes{} faster than BLAST and at
    least 2.5\texttimes{} faster than InterProScan. The tool is

    is a potential therapeutic approach to restore normal intestinal
    microbiota in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), which is
    associated with dysbiosis; however, treatment efficacy remains
    unclear. Hence, we studied the impact of antibiotic pretreatment
    with amoxicillin, fosfomycin, and metronidazole (AFM therapy) and
    FMT versus AFM alone. METHODS: AFM therapy was administered to
    patients for 2 weeks until 2 days before FMT. Patients' spouses or
    relatives were selected as donor candidates. Donor fecal samples
    were collected on the day of administration and transferred into
    the patient's colon by colonoscopy within 6 hours. Microbiome
    analysis was performed by 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing.
    RESULTS: Patients with mild-to-severe active UC
    (combination-therapy group, n = 21; AFM monotherapy group, n = 20)
    were included. Thirty-six patients completed this assessment
    (combination-therapy group, n = 17; AFM monotherapy group, n =
    19). A higher clinical response was observed after combination
    therapy compared with AFM monotherapy at 4 weeks after treatment.
    After the 2-week AFM therapy, the Bacteroidetes composition was
    nearly abolished. The Bacteroidetes proportion recovered in
    clinical responders at 4 weeks after FMT was not observed in the
    AFM monotherapy group. Persistent antimicrobial-associated
    dysbiosis found in the AFM monotherapy group was reversed by FMT.
    The recovery rate of Bacteroidetes at 4 weeks after FMT correlated
    with endoscopic severity. CONCLUSIONS: FMT following antimicrobial
    bowel cleansing synergistically contributes to the recovery of the
    Bacteroidetes composition, which is associated with clinical
    response and UC severity. Thus, this therapeutic protocol may be
    useful for managing UC.},

    insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of
    the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis
    approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation
    between 16S gene copies. In particular, we demonstrate that

  abstract     = {Importance Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is
    effective in preventing recurrentClostridium difficileinfection
    (RCDI). However, it is not known whether clinical efficacy differs
    by route of delivery. Objective To determine whether FMT by oral
    capsule is noninferior to colonoscopy delivery in efficacy.
    Design, Setting, and Participants Noninferiority, unblinded,
    randomized trial conducted in 3 academic centers in Alberta,
    Canada. A total of 116 adult patients with RCDI were enrolled
    between October 2014 and September 2016, with follow-up to
    December 2016. The noninferiority margin was 15\%. Interventions
    Participants were randomly assigned to FMT by capsule or by
    colonoscopy at a 1:1 ratio. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary
    outcome was the proportion of patients without RCDI 12 weeks after
    FMT. Secondary outcomes included (1) serious and minor adverse
    events, (2) changes in quality of life by the 36-Item Short Form
    Survey on a scale of 0 (worst possible quality of life) to 100
    (best quality of life), and (3) patient perception on a scale of 1
    (not at all unpleasant) to 10 (extremely unpleasant) and
    satisfaction on a scale of 1 (best) to 10 (worst). Results Among
    116 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 58 [19] years; 79 women
    [68\%]), 105 (91\%) completed the trial, with 57 patients
    randomized to the capsule group and 59 to the colonoscopy group.
    In per-protocol analysis, prevention of RCDI after a single
    treatment was achieved in 96.2\% in both the capsule group (51/53)
    and the colonoscopy group (50/52) (difference, 0\%; 1-sided 95\%
    CI, -6.1\% to infinity;P {$<$} .001), meeting the criterion for
    noninferiority. One patient in each group died of underlying
    cardiopulmonary illness unrelated to FMT. Rates of minor adverse
    events were 5.4\% for the capsule group vs 12.5\% for the
    colonoscopy group. There was no significant between-group
    difference in improvement in quality of life. A significantly
    greater proportion of participants receiving capsules rated their
    experience as ``not at all unpleasant'' (66\% vs 44\%; difference,
    22\% [95\% CI, 3\%-40\%];P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Among
    adults with RCDI, FMT via oral capsules was not inferior to
    delivery by colonoscopy for preventing recurrent infection over 12
    weeks. Treatment with oral capsules may be an effective approach
    to treating RCDI. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic
    complex inflammatory gut pathological condition, examples of which
    include Crohn\&rsquo;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),
    which is associated with significant morbidity. Although the
    etiology of IBD is unknown, gut microbiota alteration (dysbiosis)
    is considered a novel factor involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.
    The gut microbiota acts as a metabolic organ and contributes to
    human health by performing various physiological functions;
    deviation in the gut flora composition is involved in various
    disease pathologies, including IBD. This review aims to summarize
    the current knowledge of gut microbiota alteration in IBD and how
    this contributes to intestinal inflammation, as well as explore
    the potential role of gut microbiota-based treatment approaches
    for the prevention and treatment of IBD. The current literature
    has clearly demonstrated a perturbation of the gut microbiota in
    IBD patients and mice colitis models, but a clear causal link of
    cause and effect has not yet been presented. In addition, gut
    microbiota-based therapeutic approaches have also shown good
    evidence of their effects in the amelioration of colitis in animal
    models (mice) and IBD patients, which indicates that gut flora
    might be a new promising therapeutic target for the treatment of
    IBD. However, insufficient data and confusing results from
    previous studies have led to a failure to define a core microbiome
    associated with IBD and the hidden mechanism of pathogenesis,
    which suggests that well-designed randomized control trials and
    mouse models are required for further research. In addition, a
    better understanding of this ecosystem will also determine the
    role of prebiotics and probiotics as therapeutic agents in the
    management of IBD.},

    microbiota transplantation is effective in this disease, factors
    affecting its response are unknown. AIMS To establish a faecal
    microbiota transplantation treatment protocol in ulcerative
    colitis patients, and to investigate which patient or donor
    factors are responsible for the treatment success. METHODS This is
    an open controlled trial of repeated faecal microbiota
    transplantation after antibiotic pre-treatment (FMT-group, n~=~17)
    vs antibiotic pre-treatment only (AB-group, n~=~10) in 27 therapy
    refractory ulcerative colitis patients over 90~days. Faecal
    samples of donors and patients were analysed by 16SrRNA gene-based
    microbiota analysis. RESULTS In the FMT-group, 10/17 (59\%) of
    patients showed a response and 4/17 (24\%) a remission to faecal
    microbiota transplantation. Response to faecal microbiota
    transplantation was mainly influenced by the taxonomic composition
    of the donor's microbiota. Stool of donors with a high bacterial
    richness (observed species remission 946~{$\pm~$}93 vs no response
    797~{$\pm~$}181 at 15367~rps) and a high relative abundance of
    Akkermansia muciniphila (3.3~{$\pm~$}3.1\% vs 0.1~{$\pm~$}0.2\%),
    unclassified Ruminococcaceae (13.8~{$\pm~$}5.0\% vs
    7.5~{$\pm~$}3.7\%), and Ruminococcus spp. (4.9~{$\pm~$}3.5\% vs
    1.0~{$\pm~$}0.7\%) were more likely to induce remission. In
    contrast antibiotic treatment alone (AB-group) was poorly
    tolerated, probably because of a sustained decrease of intestinal
    microbial richness. CONCLUSIONS The taxonomic composition of the
    donor's intestinal microbiota is a major factor influencing the
    efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in ulcerative
    colitis patients. The design of specific microbial preparation
    might lead to new treatments for ulcerative colitis.},

    fecal bacteria in diseased populations of Crohn's disease (CD),
    Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
    Phylum level abundance analysis showed a significant reduction in
    Firmicute-derived bsh in UC and T2DM patients but not in CD
    patients, relative to healthy controls. Reduction of adh and hsdh
    genes was also seen in UC and T2DM patients, while an increase was
    observed in the CD population as compared to healthy controls. A
    further analysis of the bsh genes showed significant differences
    in the correlations of certain Firmicutes families with disease or
    healthy populations. From this observation we proceeded to analyse
    BSH protein sequences and identified BSH proteins clusters
    representing the most abundant strains in our analysis of

    (protospacers) into CRISPR loci (forming spacers flanked by

    typically undergo rapid turnover of spacers through the

  abstract     = {A key role of the gut microbiota in the
    establishment and maintenance of health, as well as in the
    pathogenesis of disease, has been identified over the past two
    decades. One of the primary modes by which the gut microbiota
    interacts with the host is by means of metabolites, which are
    small molecules that are produced as intermediate or end products
    of microbial metabolism. These metabolites can derive from
    bacterial metabolism of dietary substrates, modification of host
    molecules, such as bile acids, or directly from bacteria. Signals
    from microbial metabolites influence immune maturation, immune
    homeostasis, host energy metabolism and maintenance of mucosal
    integrity. Alterations in the composition and function of the
    microbiota have been described in many studies on IBD. Alterations
    have also been described in the metabolite profiles of patients
    with IBD. Furthermore, specific classes of metabolites, notably
    bile acids, short-chain fatty acids and tryptophan metabolites,
    have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. This Review aims

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohn's
    disease and ulcerative colitis, affect several million individuals
    worldwide. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complex
    diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological,
    molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing
    factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the
    Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed
    132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal
    molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease
    (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and
    blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a
    comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome
    during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a
    characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of
    obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial
    transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools
    (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and
    levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity
    were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with
    characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts.
    Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical,
    and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study's
    infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available
    through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database
    (http://ibdmdb.org), provide the most comprehensive description to

    microbiota plays a role in ulcerative colitis (UC). Fecal
    microbiota transplantation (FMT) is clearly recognized as a highly
    effective treatment for patients with recurrent Clostridium
    difficile infection and has been investigated also in patients
    with UC, with promising results.Areas covered: Literature review
    was performed to select publications concerning current evidence
    on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of UC, and on
    the effectiveness of FMT in this disorder.Expert opinion: The
    randomized controlled trials published investigating the use of
    FMT suggested a potential role for FMT in the treatment of mild to
    moderate UC. However, given several unanswered questions regarding
    donor selection, dose, route of administration and duration of
    therapy, this is not yet recommended as a viable therapy option.
    FMT has allowed for more in depth investigation with regards to
    the role the gut microbiota may be playing in UC. This knowledge
    is critical to identifying where FMT may appropriately fit in the
    UC treatment paradigm. As our understanding of the role the
    microbiome plays in this chronic disease, FMT, and then eventually
    defined microbes, will hopefully serve in a complementary role to
    conventional IBD therapies.},

    adjunct to corticosteroids in acute ulcerative colitis. METHODS:
    Seventy consecutive patients with mild (n = 37) or moderately
    active (n = 33) ulcerative colitis were randomized to receive oral
    ciprofloxacin (250 mg b.i.d., n = 34) or placebo (n = 36) for 14
    days. In addition, they were given oral prednisolone (initial dose
    20 or 40 mg for mild and moderately active ulcerative colitis,
    respectively) and rectal betamethasone enemas (2 g at night) for
    7-9 weeks. All patients were receiving olsalazine (0.5 g twice
    daily). At study entry, the groups were similar with respect to
    age, sex, extent, duration, and severity of disease, and previous
    treatments. Patients were assessed clinically, endoscopically, and
    histologically before, at the end of the trial (day 14), and on
    completion of steroid treatment, or at any time worsening of
    symptoms or a complication of ulcerative colitis occurred.
    RESULTS: At the end of the study, 24 patients (70.5\%) in the
    ciprofloxacin group and 26 patients (72\%) in the placebo group
    achieved remission (p {$>$} 0.1, Yates chi 2). Ten patients in
    each group necessitated higher doses of oral (n = 12) or
    intravenous (n = 8) steroids. Of the latter patients, two
    underwent emergency colectomy without perioperative deaths.
    Clostridium difficile toxin A was not detected in nonresponders to

  abstract     = {Background. Microbial source tracking methods are
    used to determine the origin of contaminating bacteria and other
    microorganisms, particularly in contaminated water systems. The
    Bayesian SourceTracker approach uses deep-sequencing marker gene
    libraries (16S ribosomal RNA) to determine the proportional
    contributions of bacteria from many potential source environments
    to a given sink environment simultaneously. Since its development,
    SourceTracker has been applied to an extensive diversity of
    studies, from beach contamination to human behavior. Methods.
    Here, we demonstrate a novel application of SourceTracker to work
    with metagenomic datasets and tested this approach using sink
    samples from a study of coastal marine environments. Source
    environment metagenomes were obtained from metagenomics studies of
    gut, freshwater, marine, sand and soil environments. As part of
    this effort, we implemented features for determining the stability
    of source proportion estimates, including precision visualizations
    for performance optimization, and performed domain-specific
    source-tracking analyses (i.e., Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota and
    viruses). We also applied SourceTracker to metagenomic libraries
    generated from samples collected from the International Space
    Station (ISS). Results. SourceTracker proved highly effective at
    predicting the composition of known sources using shotgun
    metagenomic libraries. In addition, we showed that different
    taxonomic domains sometimes presented highly divergent pictures of
    environmental source origins for both the coastal marine and ISS
    samples. These findings indicated that applying SourceTracker to
    separate domains may provide a deeper understanding of the
    microbial origins of complex, mixed-source environments, and
    further suggested that certain domains may be preferable for
    tracking specific sources of contamination.},

    difficult to treat, and standard therapy does not always induce
    remission. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an
    alternative approach that induced remission in small series of
    patients with active UC. We investigated its safety and efficacy
    in a placebo-controlled randomized trial. Methods We performed a
    parallel study of patients with active UC without infectious
    diarrhea. Participants were examined by flexible sigmoidoscopy
    when the study began and then were randomly assigned to groups
    that received FMT (50 mL, via enema, from healthy anonymous
    donors; n = 38) or placebo (50 mL water enema; n = 37) once weekly
    for 6 weeks. Patients, clinicians, and investigators were blinded
    to the groups. The primary outcome was remission of UC, defined as
    a Mayo score {$\leq$}2 with an endoscopic Mayo score of 0, at week
    7. Patients provided stool samples when the study began and during
    each week of FMT for microbiome analysis. The trial was stopped
    early for futility by the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee,
    but all patients already enrolled in the trial were allowed to
    complete the study. Results Seventy patients completed the trial
    (3 dropped out from the placebo group and 2 from the FMT group).
    Nine patients who received FMT (24\%) and 2 who received placebo
    (5\%) were in remission at 7 weeks (a statistically significant
    difference in risk of 17\%; 95\% confidence interval, 2\%-33\%).
    There was no significant difference in adverse events between
    groups. Seven of the 9 patients in remission after FMT received
    fecal material from a single donor. Three of the 4 patients with
    UC {$\leq$}1 year entered remission, compared with 6 of 34 of
    those with UC {$>$}1 year (P =.04, Fisher's exact test). Stool
    from patients receiving FMT had greater microbial diversity,
    compared with baseline, than that of patients given the placebo (P
    =.02, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusions FMT induces remission in a
    significantly greater percentage of patients with active UC than
    placebo, with no difference in adverse events. Fecal donor and
    time of UC appear to affect outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov Number:

  abstract     = {Background The intestinal microbiota is implicated
    in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Faecal microbiota
    transplantation is a novel form of therapeutic microbial
    manipulation, but its efficacy in ulcerative colitis is uncertain.
    We aimed to establish the efficacy of intensive-dosing,
    multidonor, faecal microbiota transplantation in active ulcerative
    colitis. Methods We conducted a multicentre, double-blind,
    randomised, placebo-controlled trial at three hospitals in
    Australia. We randomly allocated patients with active ulcerative
    colitis (Mayo score 4\textendash 10) in a 1:1 ratio, using a
    pre-established randomisation list, to either faecal microbiota
    transplantation or placebo colonoscopic infusion, followed by
    enemas 5 days per week for 8 weeks. Patients, treating clinicians,
    and other study staff were unaware of the assigned treatment.
    Faecal microbiota transplantation enemas were each derived from
    between three and seven unrelated donors. The primary outcome was
    steroid-free clinical remission with endoscopic remission or
    response (Mayo score {$\leq$}2, all subscores {$\leq$}1, and
    {$\geq$}1 point reduction in endoscopy subscore) at week 8.
    Analysis was by modified intention-to-treat and included all
    patients receiving one study dose. We performed 16S rRNA stool
    analysis to assess associated microbial changes. This trial is
    registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01896635. The trial
    has ended; this report presents the final analysis. Findings From
    November, 2013, to May, 2015, 85 patients were enrolled to our
    trial, of whom 42 were randomly assigned faecal microbiota
    transplantation and 43 were allocated placebo. One patient
    assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and three allocated
    placebo did not receive study treatment and were excluded from the
    analysis. The primary outcome was achieved in 11 (27\%) of 41
    patients allocated faecal microbiota transplantation versus three
    (8\%) of 40 who were assigned placebo (risk ratio 3{$\cdot$}6,
    95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}1\textendash 11{$\cdot$}9; p=0{$\cdot$}021).
    Adverse events were reported by 32 (78\%) of 41 patients allocated
    faecal microbiota transplantation and 33 (83\%) of 40 who were
    assigned placebo; most were self-limiting gastrointestinal
    complaints, with no significant difference in number or type of
    adverse events between treatment groups. Serious adverse events
    occurred in two patients assigned faecal microbiota
    transplantation and in one allocated placebo. Microbial diversity
    increased with and persisted after faecal microbiota
    transplantation. Several bacterial taxa were associated with
    clinical outcome; in particular, the presence of Fusobacterium spp
    was associated with lack of remission. Interpretation
    Intensive-dosing, multidonor, faecal microbiota transplantation
    induces clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in active
    ulcerative colitis and is associated with distinct microbial
    changes that relate to outcome. Faecal microbiota transplantation
    is, thus, a promising new therapeutic option for ulcerative
    colitis. Future work should focus on precisely defining the
    optimum treatment intensity and the role of donor\textendash
    recipient matching based on microbial profiles. Funding Broad

    has been investigated as a potential treatment for inflammatory
    bowel disease [IBD]. We thus performed a systematic review and
    meta-analysis assessing the effectiveness and safety of FMT in
    IBD. Methods: A systematic review was conducted until January
    2017. Studies were excluded if patients had co-infection or data
    were pooled across disease subtypes (ulcerative colitis [UC],
    Crohn's disease [CD], pouchitis). Clinical remission was
    established as the primary outcome. Pooled effect sizes and 95\%
    confidence intervals were obtained using the random effects model.
    Results: In all, 53 studies were included [41 in UC, 11 in CD, 4
    in pouchitis]. Overall, 36\% [201/555] of UC, 50.5\% [42/83] of
    CD, and 21.5\% [5/23] of pouchitis patients achieved clinical
    remission. Among cohort studies, the pooled proportion achieving
    clinical remission was 33\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] =
    23\%-43\%] for UC and 52\% [95\% CI = 31\%-72\%] for CD, both with
    moderate risk of heterogeneity. For four RCTs in UC, significant
    benefit in clinical remission (pooled odds ratios [[P-OR] = 2.89,
    95\% CI = 1.36-6.13, p = 0.006) with moderate heterogeneity
    [Cochran's Q, p = 0.188; I2 = 37\%] was noted. Sub-analyses
    suggest remission in UC improved with increased number of FMT
    infusions and lower gastrointestinal tract administration. Most
    adverse events were transient gastrointestinal complaints.
    Microbiota analysis was performed in 24 studies, with many
    identifying increased diversity and a shift in recipient
    microbiota profile towards the donor post-FMT. Conclusions: FMT
    appears effective in UC remission induction, but long-term
    durability and safety remain unclear. Additional well-designed
    controlled studies of FMT in IBD are needed, especially in CD and
    pouchitis.},

  abstract     = {Background \& Aims Fecal microbiota transplantation
    (FMT) can induce remission in patients with ulcerative colitis
    (UC). In a randomized controlled trial of FMT in patients with
    active UC, we aimed to identify bacterial taxonomic and functional
    factors associated with response to therapy. Methods We performed
    a double-blind trial of 81 patients with active UC randomly
    assigned to groups that received an initial colonoscopic infusion
    and then intensive multidonor FMT or placebo enemas, 5 d/wk for 8
    weeks. Patients in the FMT group received blended homogenized
    stool from 3\textendash 7 unrelated donors. Patients in the
    placebo group were eligible to receive open-label FMT after the
    double-blind study period. We collected 314 fecal samples from the
    patients at screening, every 4 weeks during treatment, and 8 weeks
    after the blinded or open-label FMT therapy. We also collected 160
    large-bowel biopsy samples from the patients at study entry, at
    completion of 8 weeks of blinded therapy, and at the end of
    open-label FMT, if applicable. We analyzed 105 fecal samples from
    the 14 individual donors (n~= 55), who in turn contributed to 21
    multidonor batches (n~= 50). Bacteria in colonic and fecal samples
    were analyzed by both 16S ribosomal RNA gene and transcript
    amplicon sequencing; 285 fecal samples were analyzed by shotgun
    metagenomics, and 60 fecal samples were analyzed for metabolome
    features. Results FMT increased microbial diversity and altered
    composition, based on analyses of colon and fecal samples
    collected before vs after FMT. Diversity was greater in fecal and
    colon samples collected before and after FMT treatment from
    patients who achieved remission compared with patients who did
    not. Patients in remission after FMT had enrichment of Eubacterium
    hallii and Roseburia inulivorans compared with patients who did
    not achieve remission after FMT and had increased levels of
    short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary bile acids.
    Patients who did not achieve remission had enrichment of
    Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Sutterella wadsworthensis, and
    Escherichia species and increased levels of heme and
    lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Bacteroides in donor stool were
    associated with remission in patients receiving FMT, and
    Streptococcus species in donor stool was associated with no
    response to FMT. Conclusions In an analysis of fecal and colonic
    mucosa samples from patients receiving FMT for active UC and stool
    samples from donors, we associated specific bacteria and metabolic
    pathways with induction of remission. These findings may be of
    value in the design of microbe-based therapies for UC.

    Development of a robust bacterial taxonomy has been hindered by an

    extent, by the historical use of phenotypes to guide
    classification. Culture-independent sequencing technologies have
    matured sufficiently that a comprehensive genome-based taxonomy is
    now possible. We used a concatenated protein phylogeny as the
    basis for a bacterial taxonomy that conservatively removes
    polyphyletic groups and normalizes taxonomic ranks on the basis of
    relative evolutionary divergence. Under this approach, 58\% of the
    94,759 genomes comprising the Genome Taxonomy Database had changes
    to their existing taxonomy. This result includes the description
    of 99 phyla, including six major monophyletic units from the
    subdivision of the Proteobacteria, and amalgamation of the
    Candidate Phyla Radiation into a single phylum. Our taxonomy
    should enable improved classification of uncultured bacteria and
    provide a sound basis for ecological and evolutionary studies.},

    infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Strategies that aim to
    reduce serum cholesterol through modulation of liver enzymes have
    been successful in decreasing the risk of developing
    atherosclerosis and reducing mortality. Statins, which inhibit
    cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver, are considered among the
    most successful compounds developed for the treatment of
    cardiovascular disease. However, recent debate surrounding their
    effectiveness and safety prompts consideration of alternative

    catabolism through bile acid (BA) synthesis. Targeting the enzymes
    that convert cholesterol to BAs represents a promising alternative
    to other cholesterol-lowering approaches that treat
    atherosclerosis as well as fatty liver diseases and diabetes
    mellitus. Compounds that modify the activity of these pathways
    have been developed; however, there remains a lack of
    consideration of biological sex. This is necessary in light of
    strong evidence for sexual dimorphisms not only in the incidence
    and progression of the diseases they influence but also in the
    expression and activity of the proteins affected and in the manner
    in which men and women respond to drugs that modify lipid handling

    luminal colonic microbiota (bacteria and fungi). Paired colonic
    biopsies were evaluated for histological response, host gene
    expression, and transcriptionally active mucosa-associated
    microbiota pre- and post-FMT. Results: Delivery of a single
    colonoscopic FMT effectively reduced clinical symptoms in one
    third of ulcerative colitis patients, irrespective of
    antimicrobial pre-treatment Relative risk: 1.25 (0.61,2.25)].
    Mucosal appearance (endoscopic subscore) improved significantly
    more in treatment-responsive patients than in non-responsive
    patients. Clinical response was independent of evidence for
    microbiota engraftment based on fecal samples. Mucosal gene
    expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR1 and 9) and inflammatory
    markers(IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, TGF-{$\beta$}) decreased in clinical
    responders significantly more than in non-responders, whereas
    occludin gene expression increased significantly more.
    Transcriptionally active mucosa-associated Parabacteroides,
    Prevotella, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium, Eggerthella and
    Dorea were positively associated with markers of mucosal
    inflammation, while a specific Bacteroides was associated with
    less inflammation. Conclusion: FMT reduced mucosal inflammation by
    endoscopic evaluation and by colonic biopsy gene expression to a
    greater degree in treatment-responsive UC patients than in
    non-responsive patients. Clinical response did not differ between
    patients with or without an antimicrobial pre-treatment; however,
    our study was underpowered for a robust evaluation of efficacy of
    antimicrobial pre-treatment for FMT. Clinical response was not
    associated with engraftment of donor microbiota, but rather
    related to enrichment of specific bacteria both in the feces and
    on the colonic mucosa. Specific, transcriptionally active
    mucosa-associated bacteria correlated with immune markers of
    active and resolved disease.},

    microbiota has been proposed as a treatment for inflammatory bowel
    diseases (IBD), but there are no established associations between
    specific microbes and IBD. We performed a systematic review to
    identify frequent associations. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE,
    EMBASE, Cochrane CDSR, and CENTRAL databases, through April 2,
    2018 for studies that compared intestinal microbiota (from fecal
    or colonic or ileal tissue samples) among patients (adult or
    pediatric) with IBD vs healthy individuals (controls). The primary
    outcome was difference in specific taxa in fecal or intestinal
    tissue samples from patients with IBD vs controls. We used the
    Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess the quality of studies included
    in the review. Results: We identified 2631 citations; 48 studies
    from 45 articles were included in the analysis. Most studies
    evaluated adults with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. All 3
    studies of Christensenellaceae and Coriobacteriaceae and 6 of 11
    studies of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii reported a decreased
    amount of those organisms compared with controls, whereas 2
    studies each of Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Escherichia coli
    revealed an increased amount in patients with Crohn's disease. For
    patients with ulcerative colitis, Eubacterium rectale and
    Akkermansia were decreased in all 3 studies whereas E coli was
    increased in 4 of 9 studies. The microbiota diversity was either
    decreased or not different in patients with IBD vs controls. Fewer
    than 50\% of the studies stated comparable sexes and ages of cases
    and controls. Conclusions: In a systematic review, we found
    evidence for differences in abundances of some bacteria in
    patients with IBD vs controls, but we cannot make conclusions due
    to inconsistent results and methods among studies. Further
    large-scale studies, with better methods of assessing microbe
    populations, are needed},

  abstract     = {Background \& Aims Several case series have reported
    the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for
    ulcerative colitis (UC). We assessed the efficacy and safety of
    FMT for patients with UC in a double-blind randomized trial.
    Methods Patients with mild to moderately active UC (n = 50) were
    assigned to groups that underwent FMT with feces from healthy
    donors or were given autologous fecal microbiota (control); each
    transplant was administered via nasoduodenal tube at the start of
    the study and 3 weeks later. The study was performed at the
    Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam from June 2011 through May
    2014. The composite primary end point was clinical remission
    (simple clinical colitis activity index scores {$\leq$}2) combined
    with {$\geq$}1-point decrease in the Mayo endoscopic score at week
    12. Secondary end points were safety and microbiota composition by
    phylogenetic microarray in fecal samples. Results Thirty-seven
    patients completed the primary end point assessment. In the
    intention-to-treat analysis, 7 of 23 patients who received fecal
    transplants from healthy donors (30.4\%) and 5 of 25 controls
    (20.0\%) achieved the primary end point (P =.51). In the
    per-protocol analysis, 7 of 17 patients who received fecal
    transplants from healthy donors (41.2\%) and 5 of 20 controls
    (25.0\%) achieved the primary end point (P =.29). Serious adverse
    events occurred in 4 patients (2 in the FMT group), but these were
    not considered to be related to the FMT. At 12 weeks, the
    microbiota of responders in the FMT group was similar to that of
    their healthy donors; remission was associated with proportions of
    Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa. Conclusions In this phase 2
    trial, there was no statistically significant difference in
    clinical and endoscopic remission between patients with UC who
    received fecal transplants from healthy donors and those who
    received their own fecal microbiota, which may be due to limited
    numbers. However, the microbiota of responders had distinct
    features from that of nonresponders, warranting further study.

    role in nearly all aspects of today's basic and clinical research.
    GRCh38 is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since
    2009; it reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and
    encompasses modifications ranging from thousands of single base
    changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures, and
    localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new
    approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and used
    data from new genome mapping technologies and single haplotype
    resources to identify and resolve larger assembly issues. For the
    first time, the reference assembly contains sequence-based
    representations for the centromeres. We also expanded the number
    of alternate loci to create a reference that provides a more
    robust representation of human population variation. We
    demonstrate that the updates render the reference an improved
    annotation substrate, alter read alignments in unchanged regions,
    and impact variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci. We
    additionally evaluated a collection of new de novo long-read
    haploid assemblies and conclude that although the new assemblies
    compare favorably to the reference with respect to continuity,
    error rate, and gene completeness, the reference still provides
    the best representation for complex genomic regions and coding
    sequences. We assert that the collected updates in GRCh38 make the
    newer assembly a more robust substrate for comprehensive analyses
    that will promote our understanding of human biology and advance
    our efforts to improve health.},

    {$<$}p{$>$}Sequence variation is used to quantify population
    structure and identify genetic determinants of phenotypes that
    vary within species. In the human microbiome and other
    environments, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are
    frequently detected by aligning metagenomic sequencing reads to
    catalogs of genes or genomes. But this requires high-performance
    computing and enough read coverage to distinguish SNPs from
    sequencing errors. We solved these problems by developing the
    GenoTyper for Prokaytotes (GT-Pro), a suite of novel methods to
    catalog SNPs from genomes and use exact k-mer matches to perform
    ultra-fast reference-based SNP calling from metagenomes. Compared
    to read alignment, GT-Pro is more accurate and two orders of
    magnitude faster. We discovered 104 million SNPs in 909 human gut
    species, characterized their global population structure, and
    tracked pathogenic strains. GT-Pro democratizes strain-level
    microbiome analysis by making it possible to genotype hundreds of
    metagenomes on a personal computer.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Software

    within a species engraft in an all-or-nothing manner and
    previously undetected strains frequently colonize patients

    that have been known for a long time for their critical roles in

    microbiota in the intestine, greatly expanding the molecular

  abstract     = {Introduction Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
    thought to arise from an abnormal immune response to the gut
    microbiota. IBD is associated with altered intestinal microbial
    community structure and functionality, which may contribute to
    inflammation and complications such as colon cancer and liver
    disease. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is associated with
    IBD and markedly increases the risk of colon cancer. We
    hypothesized that secondary bile acids, which are products of
    microbial metabolism, are increased in PSC patients. Aim Here, we
    profiled the fecal bile acid composition and gut microbiota of
    participants with IBD and PSC, as well as healthy participants.
    Additionally, we tested the effects of vancomycin, a proposed
    treatment for PSC, on gut microbiota and fecal bile acid
    composition in participants with IBD and PSC. Methods Fecal
    samples were collected from patients with IBD, IBD/PSC and healthy
    controls and fecal bile acids and DNA for microbiota analysis were
    extracted. Fecal bile acids were averaged over a seven-day period.
    For subjects with IBD/PSC, oral vancomycin 500mg twice a day was
    administered and fecal samples were collected for up to eleven
    weeks. Results Participants with IBD and PSC had less fecal
    microbial diversity at baseline relative to controls. While there
    was some evidence of altered conversion of cholic acid to
    deoxycholic acid, no substantial differences were found in the
    fecal bile acid profiles of patients with IBD and PSC (n=7)
    compared to IBD alone (n=8) or healthy controls (n=8). Oral
    vancomycin was a potent inhibitor of secondary bile acid
    production in participants with IBD and PSC, particularly
    deoxycholic acid, although no changes in liver biochemistry
    patterns were noted over a two week period. Conclusion In this
    pilot study, bile acid profiles were overall similar among
    patients with IBD and PSC, IBD alone, and healthy controls.
    Microbiota diversity was reduced in those with PSC and IBD

  abstract     = {The secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and
    lithocholic acid (LCA), formed by gut microbiota from primary bile
    acids via a multi-step 7{$\alpha$}-dehydroxylation reaction, have
    wide-ranging effects on host metabolism and play an important role
    in health and disease. A few 7{$\alpha$}-dehydroxylating strains
    have been isolated, where bile acid-inducible (bai) genes were
    organized in a gene cluster and encoded major enzymes involved.
    However, only little is known on diversity and abundance of
    intestinal bacteria catalysing DCA/LCA formation in the human gut
    in situ. In this study, we took the opportunity to screen
    metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from sequence data of stool
    samples provided by two recent studies along with newly available
    gut-derived isolates for the presence of the bai gene cluster. We
    revealed in total 765 and 620 MAGs encoding the potential to form
    DCA/LCA that grouped into 21 and 26 metagenomic species,
    respectively. The majority of MAGs (92.4 and 90.3\%) were
    associated with a Ruminococcaceae clade that still lacks an
    isolate, whereas less MAGs belonged to Lachnospiraceae along with
    eight new isolates (n total = 11) that contained the bai genes.
    Only a few MAGs were linked to Peptostreptococcaceae. Signatures
    for horizontal transfer of bai genes were observed. This study

  abstract     = {Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has become a
    highly effective bacteriotherapy for recurrent Clostridium
    difficile infection. Meanwhile the efficacy of FMT for treating
    chronic diseases associated with microbial dysbiosis has so far
    been modest with a much higher variability in patient response.
    Notably, a number of studies suggest that FMT success is dependent
    on the microbial diversity and composition of the stool donor,
    leading to the proposition of the existence of FMT super-donors.
    The identification and subsequent characterization of super-donor
    gut microbiomes will inevitably advance our understanding of the
    microbial component of chronic diseases and allow for more
    targeted bacteriotherapy approaches in the future. Here, we review
    the evidence for super-donors in FMT and explore the concept of
    keystone species as predictors of FMT success. Possible effects of
    host-genetics and diet on FMT engraftment and maintenance are also
    considered. Finally, we discuss the potential long-term
    applicability of FMT for chronic disease and highlight how
    super-donors could provide the basis for dysbiosis-matched FMTs.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND Gut microbiota and its metabolites may be
    involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
    Several clinical studies have recently shown that patients with
    ulcerative colitis (UC) have altered profiles of fecal bile acids
    (BAs). It was observed that BA receptors Takeda G-protein-coupled
    receptor 5 (TGR5) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) participate in
    intestinal inflammatory responses by regulating
    NF-{\fontencoding{LELA}\selectfont\char91}B signaling. We
    hypothesized that altered profiles of fecal BAs might be
    correlated with gut microbiota and inflammatory responses in
    patients with UC. AIM To investigate the changes in fecal BAs and
    analyze the relationship of BAs with gut microbiota and
    inflammation in patients with UC. METHODS The present study used
    16S rDNA sequencing technology to detect the differences in the
    intestinal flora between UC patients and healthy controls (HCs).
    Fecal BAs were measured by targeted metabolomics approaches.
    Mucosal TGR5 and VDR expression was analyzed using
    immunohistochemistry, and serum inflammatory cytokine levels were
    detected by ELISA. RESULTS Thirty-two UC patients and twenty-three
    HCs were enrolled in this study. It was found that the diversity
    of gut microbiota in UC patients was reduced compared with that in
    HCs. Firmicutes, Clostridium IV, Butyricicoccus, Clostridium XlVa,
    Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia were significantly decreased in
    patients with UC (P = 3.75E-05, P = 8.28E-07, P = 0.0002, P =
    0.003, P = 0.0003, and P = 0.0004, respectively). Proteobacteria,
    Escherichia, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus were
    significantly enriched in the UC group (P = 2.99E-09, P =
    3.63E-05, P = 8.59E-05, P = 0.003, and P = 0.016, respectively).
    The concentrations of fecal secondary BAs, such as lithocholic
    acid, deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, glycolithocholic
    acid, and taurolithocholate, in UC patients were significantly
    lower than those in HCs (P = 8.1E-08, P = 1.2E-07, P = 3.5E-04, P
    = 1.9E-03, and P = 1.8E-02, respectively) and were positively
    correlated with Butyricicoccus, Roseburia, Clostridium IV,
    Faecalibacterium, and Clostridium XlVb (P {$<$} 0.01). The
    concentrations of primary BAs, such as taurocholic acid, cholic
    acid, taurochenodeoxycholate, and glycochenodeoxycholate, in UC
    patients were significantly higher than those in HCs (P = 5.3E-03,
    P = 4E-02, P = 0.042, and P = 0.045, respectively) and were
    positively related to Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Streptococcus,
    Lactobacillus, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (P {$<$} 0.01). The
    expression of TGR5 was significantly elevated in UC patients
    (0.019 {$\pm$} 0.013 vs 0.006 {$\pm$} 0.003, P = 0.0003). VDR
    expression in colonic mucosal specimens was significantly
    decreased in UC patients (0.011 {$\pm$} 0.007 vs 0.016 {$\pm$}
    0.004, P = 0.033). CONCLUSION Fecal BA profiles are closely
    related to the gut microbiota and serum inflammatory cytokines.
    Dysregulation of the gut microbiota and altered constitution of
    fecal BAs may participate in regulating inflammatory responses via
    the BA receptors TGR5 and VDR.},
